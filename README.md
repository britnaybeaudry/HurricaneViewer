# HurricaneViewer
This tool displays hourly precipitation, bidaily sea surface temperature, and max wind speed for a given area. The code is figured for 2017 hurricane Maria, but users can change the geometry, start/end date, and point of interest to view other hurricanes.

The data sources are as follows:
* Precipitation: Jaxa Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP)
* Sea Surface Temperature: Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM), Water Temperature and Salinity
* Hurricane Path & Max Wind Speed: NOAA NHC Best Track Data (HURDAT2) Atlantic Hurricane Catalog
